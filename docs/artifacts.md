# 🪃 Artifacts

Artifacts are rare and powerful relics scattered throughout the Wilderness. Each one carries hidden properties that can change the way you play, rewarding those brave enough to explore the unknown.

## 🔎 Where to Find Artifacts
Artifacts are most often discovered in loot chests across the Wilderness. Any chest that generates treasure has a chance to contain one—if you’re willing to seek it out.

You may encounter them in:
- Villages and Pillager Outposts
- Natural Caverns and Mineshafts
- Strongholds
- Nether Fortresses
- Newly discovered Wilderness structures
- Wilderness Dungeons, rich with danger and reward

## 🧭 Identifying Artifacts
Newly found artifacts are **unidentified**. Until identified, they cannot be equipped or used. Bring them to an **Artifact Workshop** to uncover their hidden attributes and unlock their true potential.

## ⚔️ Using Artifacts
Once identified, artifacts can be equipped through the **GEAR menu**. Access it directly from your **Adventurer’s Journal** or with the `/gear` command. Choose wisely—the right artifact can turn the tide of your adventure.
