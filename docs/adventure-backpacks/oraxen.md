# How to merge Adventure Backpacks resource pack with Oraxen

This is actually a very simple process. You can follow the text guide, or watch the video!

**Step 1**
> Stop your server.

**Step 2**
> Copy contents of Adventure Backpacks' resource pack (everything in `Adventure Backpacks/assets/`, at the moment of writing, it's just the `minecraft` folder.)

**Step 3**
> Paste the copied folder into `plugins/Oraxen/pack/assets`

Done! Now start your server and enjoy Oraxen and Adventure Backpacks working together :heart:
