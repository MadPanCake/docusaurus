# 🍳 Cooking

**Cooking** is a special feature that introduces the **Cooking Pot**, a beautifully animated block where adventurers can prepare lavish dishes. By combining new and existing foods, you can create meals that are not only highly filling but also grant **long-lasting potion effects**.


## 📜 How to Discover Recipes
To cook a dish, you must first uncover its **recipe**. Recipes can be found while exploring the **Wilderness**, tucked away inside loot chests. Once obtained, simply hold the recipe and right-click on a **Cooking Pot** to learn it permanently.

## 🖋 Crafting Your Own Recipes
Adventurers aren’t limited to default recipes—you can create your own. By editing the `unlimited_adventures/CustomItems/cooking_recipes.yml` file, entirely new dishes can be added to your world, expanding the possibilities of the Cooking Pot.
