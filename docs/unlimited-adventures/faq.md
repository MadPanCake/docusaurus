## :arrow_forward: Setup

#### What Minecraft version is the setup using?
> The setup is running natively on **Paper 1.21**

#### 🌲 Trees look weird!
> Our tree leaves have a custom, bushy texture, that makes the foliage beautiful.\

⚙️ *If you prefer, this feature can be easily removed from the resource pack.*
