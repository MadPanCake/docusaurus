# How to make Unlimited Adventures work with ItemsAdder

In order for the setup to work with ItemsAdder, you need to merge the resource pack with ItemsAdder.\
It's actually a very simple process. Please refer to the text guide and use the video as a supplement.


#### Step 1
> :red_circle: Stop your server.

#### Step 2
> ❌ Remove `resource-pack=` link from `server.properties`

#### Step 3
> :wrench: Find the `use_oraxen_or_itemsadder` setting in `unlimited_adventures/AdventureCore/resource_pack` and set it to `true`

#### Step 4
> ❌ Remove `modelengine` folder from the resource pack folder `assets/modelengine` (it will be auto-generated by ItemsAdder)

#### Step 5
> Put Unlimited Adventures' resource pack into `plugins/ItemsAdder/contents`

:::tip[Find your resource pack]

Done! Now start your server and enjoy Unlimited Adventures and ItemsAdder working together :heart:
