# :o: How to add the World Border?

You can easily add a world border, in order to restrain the gameplay area, to prevent players from travelling too far or creating new chunks.
Another reason to do it is to reduce the lags or make the gameplay more competitive.

#### Step 1
> Specify the world center with: `/worldborder center 0 0`

#### Step 2
> Specify the world border size with: `/worldborder set 5000`

That's it! You have a 5000x5000 border ready!
