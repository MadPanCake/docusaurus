# How to make Unlimited Adventures work with Oraxen

In order for the setup to work with Oraxen, you need to merge the resource pack with Oraxen.\
It's actually a very simple process. Please refer to the text guide and use the video as a supplement.

**Step 1**
> :red_circle: Stop your server.

#### Step 2
> ❌ Remove `resource-pack=` link from `server.properties`

#### Step 3
> :wrench: Find the `use_oraxen_or_itemsadder` setting in `unlimited_adventures/AdventureCore/resource_pack` and set it to `true`

#### Step 4
> ❌ Remove `modelengine` folder from the resource pack folder `assets/modelengine` (it will be auto-generated by Oraxen)

#### Step 5
> Copy contents of Unlimited Adventures' resource pack (everything in `Unlimited Adventures/assets/`)
:::tip[Find your resource pack]
Don't know how to find your resource pack? Refer to [Resource Pack](resource-pack)
:::
#### Step 6
> 💾 Paste the copied folder into `plugins/Oraxen/pack/assets`

Done! Now start your server and enjoy Unlimited Adventures and Oraxen working together :heart:
