# 100% Money Back Guarantee

We are the only studio that's so confident with it's products that we offer a **100% Money Back Guarantee!**\
If you purchase a qualified product and after testing it, you decide that it's not satisfying, you can [ask for a refund](https://discord.gg/wdBFC7Hc6X).


## :moneybag: Refunds
- Our software can be refunded for up to 30 days after purchase.
- Refund is impossible if you purchase Unlimited Adventures along with other items in the basket. This is a BuiltByBit limitation (precisely, Tebex limitation).
- Breaking TOS or acting in malicious intent might affect your right to request a refund.
- The refund can take up to a week before it's processed.


## ❤️ Can I buy again?

The development tempo of Unlimited Adventures causes many users to reconsider their refunds and ask us if purchasing the setup again is possible. The answer is: absolutely!\
We love games and we simply don’t have the heart to prevent anyone from having fun with games too!

If you’d like to repurchase, please message me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wdBFC7Hc6X) or [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/members/simon-dev.171954/)!
